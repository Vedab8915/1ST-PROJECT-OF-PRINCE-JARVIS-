# ⚙️ JARVIS
### JARVIS — Personal AI Assistant by P.R.I.N.C.E

> 📺 **[JARVIS Project]**

A real-time voice AI that can hear, see, speak, and control your computer — on any OS. Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. Built on the Gemini Live API for native audio streaming, delivering zero subscriptions and total digital autonomy.

---

## ✨ Overview

**JARVIS is a real-time personal AI assistant.** A holographic head sits at the centre of the HUD and **speaks your assistant's words with real lip-sync** — not a jaw flapping to the volume meter, but actual mouth shapes: lips closing on *m*, *b*, *p*, spreading on *i*, rounding on *u*. Brows ride the sentence, the eyes flick between fixation points, and it blinks. Turn the sound down and you can follow roughly what it just said.

It ships as **zero extra dependencies and one 25 KB asset**. The face is real measured human geometry; everything else — the skull, the rig, the lighting — is generated at startup and drawn in software, so it looks identical on a gaming rig and a 2013 laptop, with no GPU driver in the loop.

The face is also the fastest status indicator in the app: it looks away while thinking, meets your eyes while listening, and lets its lids fall while asleep.

Underneath, JARVIS rebuilt how the assistant knows itself — what it is, what machine it runs on, what it can do and, new, **what it cannot do** — all assembled from the live system at session start rather than written into a prompt that goes stale.

It's not just an assistant — it's an extension of your digital life.

## 🚀 Capabilities

### Core Features
| Feature | Description |

| 🌍 Language-Free Mouth | Articulation is derived by Unicode reduction, so Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts all work from one rule set — and scripts that hide pronunciation fall back cleanly |
| 🙂 Facial Acting | Brows track the phrase, gaze saccades between fixations, natural blinking, a small nod on stressed syllables |
| 😐 Face as Status | Looks away while thinking, meets your eyes while listening, lids fall while asleep, glances down at new content |
| 🎚️ Push-to-Talk | Hold **Ctrl+Space** and the mic opens — closed the rest of the time. Truly global on Windows, window-scoped elsewhere |
| 🔇 Self-Echo Guard | Never answers its own last sentence: the tail of its own voice is recognised and dropped without muting you |
| 🪪 Runtime Self-Knowledge | Name, OS, abilities **and limits** are generated from the live system each session — rename it or add a plugin and it knows |
| 🎙️ Wake Word | Local **"Hey Jarvis"** detection — sleeps until called, auto-sleeps after 2 min of silence, and never streams audio while asleep |
| ⚡ Instant Acknowledgment | Speaks a short, context-aware reply in **your language** the instant a longer task starts — no more silent waiting |
| 🚀 Faster Live Engine | Runs on **Gemini 3.1 Flash Live** — roughly 2× faster time-to-first-word than the previous model |

## 🔄 The Foundation Update — in every Mark from LII

These four landed across **JARVIS releases at the same time**, after each of those releases had already shipped. They are not what any one of those versions originally introduced; they are the floor all of them now stand on, so moving up a Mark never costs you something the one below it had.

No new dependencies. No bundled asset files. No hardcoded language, and nothing that assumes one operating system.

### 🧠 A memory that actually remembers

The store was capped at **2,200 characters — the whole memory, not per entry** — because all of it was pasted into the system prompt on every connect, so growing the memory grew every request. When it filled, the oldest entries were deleted and one line was printed to a console nobody reads. An assistant advertised as remembering "projects, preferences and personal context" was in practice a two-page notepad that quietly forgot your sister's name after a few weeks.

Storage and prompt budget are now separate problems:

* **Nothing is deleted.** The cap is a runaway guard normal use never approaches, and if it is ever hit it says so in the activity log instead of on stdout.
* **The prompt carries a core, not a dump.** Identity in full, then the most recently updated facts, budgeted — measured at **971 characters on a memory holding 62 stored facts.** That is *smaller* than the old whole-store cap, so sessions now connect with fewer tokens than before.
* **The rest is fetched on demand.** A `recall_memory` tool searches the full store locally — no network, no second model, well under a millisecond.

The part that is easy to get wrong: **a model cannot look something up if it doesn't know the thing exists.** So the prompt also carries an **index of the keys** it had no room for. Without it, "who is Ayşe?" gets "I don't know" while `ayse_sister` sits on disk unread. That index interleaves categories rather than sorting by recency — sorted like the core, a memory with forty preferences pushed the one entry the index existed for off the end.

⚙ → **🧠 MEMORY** shows every stored fact, when it was learned, and a ✕ to forget it. Everything stays in `memory/long_term.json` on your machine.

### ↩️ Undo — it can take back what it did

JARVIS moves files, renames them, writes to them and changes your settings. None of that had a way back; if it misheard you, the only remedy was to fix it by hand.

Say **"undo"** — in any language — and it reverses its own last action:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Files** | move · rename · create · copy · write · delete · organize desktop |
| **Settings** | volume · brightness · dark mode |

Three things it deliberately does *not* do:

* **It does not guess.** Settings undo reads the current value *before* changing it. Where a platform won't report that value, nothing is registered — an undo that restores a guess is worse than no undo.
* **It does not hoard.** Undoing a write means keeping the old contents in memory, so files over 1 MB are excluded and it says so rather than holding a 200 MB log for the session.
* **It does not delete your files to undo a copy.** The reverse of a copy is removing the copy; the reverse of "create a folder" is removing it *only while it's still empty*.

`organize_desktop` gets special treatment — one command that moves dozens of files, which made it the least reversible thing the assistant could do. It journals every move and puts all of them back in one go, cleaning up the folders it created if they're still empty.

**Undo costs nothing at runtime.** It appends a closure to a list; nothing in it runs unless you ask.

### ⚠️ A confirmation the model can't forge

The old gate read like this:

```python
if action in _DANGEROUS_ACTIONS:            # {"restart", "shutdown"}
    confirmed = str(params.get("confirmed", "")).lower()
```

`confirmed` is a **tool parameter, which means the model fills it in.** Nothing stopped it sending `confirmed=yes` on the first call and nothing checked that a human was ever involved. It was a convention, not a gate. And its coverage was two actions — so `toggle_wifi`, which cuts the assistant's own connection to the Live API and therefore *cannot be asked to undo itself*, went through with no gate at all.

The token is now issued by the interface. Shutdown, restart and WiFi put a banner on the HUD and **return immediately**; the action runs only if you press CONFIRM. Nothing blocks — JARVIS keeps talking while the banner is up — so this is **cheaper than the old gate**, which burned two tool round trips on every power command.

> The split between the two mechanisms is about reversibility, not about how alarming a word sounds. Anything undoable is done at once; only the genuinely irreversible asks. An assistant that checks with you before turning the volume down is one you stop talking to.

### 🎧 It finally asks which microphone

Both audio streams opened with no device argument at all, so they always took whatever the OS called "default" — and on Windows that *moves on its own* the moment you plug a headset in. "JARVIS can't hear me" almost always meant "JARVIS is listening to the webcam".

⚙ → **🎧 AUDIO DEVICES** lets you pick the microphone and the speakers by name. Two things matter more than the dropdown:

**The list is short.** `query_devices()` returns one entry per *device × host API*, not per device — measured on an ordinary Windows machine, **41 entries for what the sound settings show as 4 microphones and 4 speakers.** The same microphone appears four times, under MME, DirectSound, WASAPI and WDM-KS, with nothing to say which is which. That is not a choice, it's a quiz. The picker takes one host API per direction, drops the "Sound Mapper" and "Primary Sound Driver" pseudo-devices that just mean "default", and deduplicates. **41 → 8.**

**Every entry has been measured, not assumed.** The obvious approach is to pick the host API with the nicest names — WASAPI on Windows, which in shared mode **doesn't resample**, so with 16 kHz in and 24 kHz out against 48 kHz hardware every open failed. Adding a rate check and moving to DirectSound passes that test on both sides, and PortAudio's DirectSound **output is a silent sink**: the stream opens, every write returns success in ~0 ms, and not one sample reaches the speakers.

| | write(2.0 s) took | |
|---|---|---|
| MME | **2.02 s** | consumed in real time |
| DirectSound | **0.00 s** | swallowed instantly |

No capability flag reports that. So the app measures it — once per host API per direction, on a background thread at startup, using silence. Two consequences worth stating plainly:

* **Each direction picks its own host API.** On Windows this lands on DirectSound for the microphone and MME for the speakers — a split no amount of reasoning would have produced.
* **The probe runs in the mode the app actually ships.** DirectSound input passes a callback stream and fails a blocking read; probing the wrong mode rejected a microphone that works perfectly.

Your choice is stored **by name, not by index** — indices shift whenever something is plugged in. If the saved device is gone, it falls back to the system default and says so in the log rather than failing to start.

### 🔗 It stops forgetting the conversation when the connection drops

`session_resumption` was switched on in the config and the handle the server sent back was **never read** — so every reconnect started an empty session. A dropped packet, or simply changing the voice, wiped the conversation. "Unlimited sessions" leaked through exactly this hole.

The handle is captured and replayed now. A network blip, or switching your microphone, keeps the conversation intact.

It is held in memory only, deliberately: writing it to disk would make a fresh launch continue yesterday's chat, which sounds appealing but breaks the session-summary flow — a conversation that never ends never produces a summary, and the "yesterday we talked about…" line in the morning briefing silently disappears. Changing the **voice** also starts clean on purpose, since resuming restores the server's session state and would likely bring the old voice back with it.

### 🩹 Fixes that came with it

* **The assistant could die on a log line.** Status lines carry emoji and arrows (`📤 file_controller → Moved: a.txt → Documents/`). On a non-UTF-8 console — cp1254 on a Turkish Windows, cp1251 on a Russian one, cp932 on a Japanese one — printing one raises `UnicodeEncodeError`, and because that print sits *after* the tool's own `try/except`, it escaped into the receive loop and took the session down.
* **Every computer command paid for two model round trips.** `computer_settings` made an *entire second Gemini call, inside the tool*, purely to translate the request into one of its own action names — because the declaration only said "The action to perform", so the model rarely filled it in. When that second call failed, the fallback was `description.lower().replace(" ", "_")`, which turns the Turkish for "turn it down" into `sesi_kis` and straight into "Unknown action". The declaration now names all 56 actions and the rest is spelling tolerance handled locally by `difflib` in microseconds. When nothing matches it suggests real action names instead of dead-ending.
* An unresolvable saved audio device, or one the driver refuses to open, falls back to the system default and says so — on both the microphone and the speakers.
* A rejected session-resumption handle is dropped after one attempt, so an expired handle can never be replayed on every retry and prevent the reconnect it exists to protect.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/P.R.I.N.C.E/Mark-LIV.git
cd Mark-LIV
python setup.py        # installs deps for YOUR OS + the browser automation engine
python main.py
```

`setup.py` only ever installs what your operating system needs — the Windows-only libraries are skipped automatically on macOS and Linux, and vice-versa. It also checks your Python version up front, so a wrong interpreter fails with a sentence instead of a wall of pip output. Prefer to do it by hand? `pip install -r requirements.txt` works too.

> ⚠️ **Installation Note:** If you hit a `ModuleNotFoundError` for an OS-specific package, install it with `pip install <module_name>`. The optional **wake word** engine is *not* installed here — grab it in one click from **⚙ → WAKE WORD** inside the app.

## 🛠️ How JARVIS Works

JARVIS starts its main application, initializes the audio and UI systems, discovers available actions and plugins, loads the configured settings and memory, and then connects the live voice session.

When you speak to JARVIS, the microphone audio is processed by the assistant, the Gemini Live API handles the real-time conversation, and JARVIS can call its discovered actions and plugins when a task requires computer control, files, browser interaction, messaging, vision, reminders, or other supported capabilities.

JARVIS keeps persistent memory locally, while the active voice conversation uses the configured Gemini Live API connection. The HUD shows the assistant state, conversation activity, and available controls.

### Setup Flow

1. Install the required Python version and project dependencies.
2. Run the setup script or install the requirements manually.
3. Start JARVIS with `python main.py`.
4. Enter/configure the Gemini API key when prompted by the application.
5. Select the microphone and speakers if needed.
6. Enable optional features such as the wake word from the JARVIS settings.
7. JARVIS then starts its main voice session and loads its actions and plugins automatically.

## 📋 Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **OS** | Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux |
| **Python** | 3.11, 3.12 or 3.13 |
| **Microphone** | Required for voice interaction (and for the "Hey Jarvis" wake word) |
| **Speakers** | Required for voice replies |
| **API Key** | Free Gemini API key (entered on first launch → `config/api_keys.json`) |
| **GPU** | **Not required.** The avatar is rendered in software |
| **Wake word** *(optional)* | One-click download from ⚙ → WAKE WORD (`openwakeword`, a few MB, fully local) |

## 🔒 Your Data

Everything stays on your machine. There is no MARK server, no telemetry and no account.

| What | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini API key, plugin credentials | `config/api_keys.json` | **Plaintext.** Anyone with your user account can read it. Treat it like a password file. |
| Dashboard TLS certificate + private key | `config/certs/` | Generated locally, self-signed, never leaves the machine. |
| What the assistant remembers about you | `memory/long_term.json` | Delete the file to make it forget everything. |

All three are listed in `.gitignore`, so a fork or a pull request cannot leak them by accident. **If you have already committed `config/api_keys.json` anywhere public, revoke that key** at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and generate a new one — removing the file in a later commit does not remove it from the history.

Your voice is streamed to Google's Gemini Live API while a session is open; that is the one thing that leaves your computer, and it stops when you mute or close the app.
